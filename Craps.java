/**
 * basic rules for playing craps are relatively simple:
 1. A player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.
 2. On this first roll, a 7 or an 11 automatically wins, and a 2, 3, or 12 
 automatically loses, and play is over. If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 are 
 rolled on this first roll, that number becomes the "point.‚Äù
 3. The player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things 
 happens: either they roll the "point" from that first roll again, 
 in which case they win; or they roll a 7, in which case they lose.
